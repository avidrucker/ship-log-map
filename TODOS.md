# To-Do's

- [ ] Implement animation of nodes appearing
- [ ] Implement animation of edges connecting one node to another
- [ ] Implement "question mark" nodes that can be transformed into specific nodes
- [ ] Implement context menu to replace current UI for adding/removing nodes, edges, renaming nodes, etc.
- [x] Implement a "save" button to save the current graph state
- [x] Implement a "load" button to load a previously saved graph state
- [ ] Implement a "new" button to clear the current graph state and start fresh with zero nodes, edges, and the camera is reset to the default position and zoom
- [ ] Implement a "debug" button to log the current graph state to the console
- [ ] Change selected node outline/border color to be the node's bright color instead of white
- [x] Implement a "delete" button to remove the currently selected node and all its edges
- [x] Implement a "rename" button to rename the currently selected node
- [x] Implement a "connect" button to connect the currently selected node to another node
- [ ] Implement a "play mode" button which hides the UI and allows the user to interact with the graph without editing it
- [ ] Implement an explicit "edit mode" button which shows the UI and allows the user to edit the graph
- [ ] Implement a "zoom to node" button which zooms the camera to the currently selected node, centering it in the viewport and zooming in to a comfortable reading/viewing level (this zoom amount should vary depending on the node size)
- [ ] Implement adding of clues/hints to edges, which can be displayed when an edge is clicked
- [ ] Implement adding of clues/hints to nodes, which can be displayed when a node is clicked
- [ ] Pressing Esc while a modal is open should close the modal (for both note editor and node renaming)
- [ ] Selecting a node will deselect all edges
- [ ] Selecting an edge will deselect all nodes
- [x] Clicking outside of the Note Editor Modal closes it, including when clicking on the background or other nodes/edges
- [x] Fix bug where edges are not properly styled when they are selected
- [x] Implement "double-edges" where each edge has a second edge below it with a thicker line and different color to mimic source material styling
- [x] See if arrows can be moved to the center of edges instead of being at the end
- [ ] Fix focused/active nodes to not have different border colors (they should match the node's color always)
- [x] Change cursor to pointer when hovering over nodes and edges
- [ ] Implement re-ordering of notes in the Note Editor Modal
- [ ] Implement "unlocking" of nodes in player mode where initially a question mark is shown on the node instead of its title and picture to indicate that a node exists, but is not yet accessible
- [ ] Implement "unlocking" of notes where, in the note viewer modal, there is an indicator that further notes exist, but are not yet accessible
